HydroFlow: ERP System for Import and Export Operations

HydroFlow is a customized ERP system designed to streamline import and export operations, built using the MVC-2 architecture. The system integrates Java for middleware, JSP for a dynamic frontend, and MySQL as the backend, ensuring a seamless and scalable solution. It features dedicated dashboards for consumers and sellers, enhancing operational efficiency and user experience.

A key aspect of HydroFlow is its structured database management, where I personally developed and optimized multiple SQL stored procedures to handle crucial operations. These procedures were integrated using the Data Access Object (DAO) pattern, ensuring efficient data retrieval, manipulation, and security. The use of JDBC facilitated robust connectivity between the application and the database, enabling smooth transactions and operations.

To enhance the user experience, I designed an intuitive and visually appealing interface using HTML, CSS, and JSP. The frontend prioritizes simplicity and navigation ease, allowing users to manage orders, track shipments, and handle transactions effortlessly. Additionally, role-based access control ensures secure authentication, directing users to appropriate dashboards based on their roles as either consumers or sellers.

HydroFlow also incorporates real-time product tracking and issue reporting functionalities, ensuring transparency in trade operations. Consumers can view product details, place orders, report product issues, and track shipments, while sellers can manage inventory, address reported concerns, and monitor sales performance.

By implementing JSP, Java Servlets, MySQL, and JDBC, HydroFlow provides a structured and well-optimized ERP solution tailored for the import and export industry. This project showcases my expertise in full-stack development, database management, secure transaction handling, and UI/UX design, ensuring a comprehensive and user-friendly ERP system.
